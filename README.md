Yo!
My name is Isaac. I am brand new to code and programming but have always had a fascination with technology, especially computers.
I am currently going through Codecademy to start learning and understanding programming. But I am wanting to learn as much as I can in this field.
My main focus in learning to coding is to mainly focus on sofware development, web development, cybersecurity, and saas.
As a hobby I love to play video games and would love to learn how to code games in my spare time.
I love music and I am always down for a new sound to jam to!
I am still a total noob at all of this but I hope to abosorb everything I can.
